# Preconditions
# -------------
#
# The necessary data files should be created by available R scripts which have been
# provided for the project "Projectathon7-VHF (distributed)" allowing to export relevant data
# from a FHIR server of your choice. This R data processing pipeline generates two data
# files named with Cohort.csv and Diagnosis.csv. You need to have these two data files at
# hand before you can import data. Therefore, run this script when the data files are
# available.
# Set the name and location of these two data files by setting them directly or using the .Rprofile
# Please don't change the file structire of these dwo data files

# Read the two data files
#file.name.loc.cohort <- "location/Cohort.csv"

  stop(paste("The data file \"", file.name.loc.cohort,
             "\" doesn't have 15 columns. This file doesn't have the structure we expected.\n",
             "Please make sure this file has the appropriate structure first and then try again."))
